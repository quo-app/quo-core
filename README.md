# Quo - Prototyping with components

Max Stein, Deniz Sokullu

### Quo solves the gap in prototyping
- Much of UX design revolves around reusing components that exist in design systems and throughout the industry
- Current limitations in prototyping tools cause designers to miss out on opportunities to test with users
- Quo helps UX designers iterate as fast as developers

*In the proposed process, designers spend less time upfront perfecting screen designs because Quo will make it easier to turn assets into prototypes and continue iterating.*

### Drawbacks to existing products

- **Limited Functionality -** (InVision, XD, Sketch, Figma) Designers can only create ‘click-through prototypes’ that are primarily for user flows by linking screens together with page transitions
- **Difficult to use and time intensive, code required -** (Principle, Adobe AE, Framer, Origami) Blank slate provided, but requires too much building for rapid prototyping
- **Poor UI -** (all tools) have become crowded and complex

*If designers are working with standard components, the prototyping tools we use should be designed around those same components*

### A Squarespace model for prototyping

- Squarespace is focused on providing users with standardized components that it has deemed essential to build a beautiful, functional website
- When a user logs into Squarespace, they know exactly what they’re going to get

### Quo simplifies producing interactive components
Designers everywhere are using text fields, dropdown or popover menus, card designs, buttons, switches, and sliders, etc

### What does Quo provide designers?
In Quo, designers can build fully functioning prototypes centered around standard components and interactions

- **Easy file transfer -** Minimize time preparing files in screen design tools before uploading and managing in Quo
- **Clear workflow -** Create interactive prototypes without code or messy arrows connecting ‘linked’ keyframes
- **Essential functionality -** Focus on mid - high level interactions in the interface for user testing
- **Centered around components -** Quo’s building tools support industry standard components creating faster testing cycles
- **Functioning prototypes to export & share -** Quo’s finished HTML prototype can be shared and interacted with on all platforms

### Beta release date - December 2018
- Based on current progress, our large feature releases are scheduled for mid-December 2018
- We plan on testing with trusted peers, and others who would be able to give us insightful feedback that would lead to a better public release

### Goals for the future of Quo

- **6 months after beta release:** additional beta features and improve overall performance / receive feedback from design community
- **1 year goal:** begin to extend usage to tablets to make it easier to design without a mouse
- **3 year goal:** Quo is a product that can be used in the AR / VR space to design digital products the way you would build with lego blocks - manipulating designs with your hands
